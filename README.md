# Flutter Chat App

A Chat App made with Flutter and Stream

## Getting Started

In the `chat_service.dart` file you will need to configure the application with your API key, that can be obtained from the [Stream dashboard](https://getstream.io/). The API key used in this repository may no longer be active by the time you read this.

For a written tutorial on using Stream and Flutter take a look at this tutorial:

Below is a video tutorial demonstrating how to use Stream and Flutter to build this example application, as well as using the Stream dashboard to create new Stream applications (API keys):
